## Description

The aim of my project was to develop a text editor that satisfies the requirements of a PWA. The text editor I created is a single-page application that can operate offline and is accessible via a web browser.

## Installation



## Dependencies

npm i

## Usage

To utilize the application through the command line (once dependencies are installed), follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the root directory of the repository in your terminal or bash.
2. Execute "npm run build" command in the command line to bundle the front-end code.
3. Execute "npm run start" command in the command line to start the server.
3. Access the port on your local host.
4. Click on the "Install" button.
